# Overview

As a software engineer I plan on expanding my knowledge base to allow myself a greater amount of creative freedom. This is part of that journey.

I wrote this basic cryptocurrency framework to be able to check some of the well-known and not-so-well known statistics. 

There are simple but important pieces of information that I have to go to several different places to find it so I wrote this to make it easier to get an overview.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

I created several one main page so far because I ran out of time, although I plan on linking each of the cryptos to their own page which will dynamically transition to information about the given cryptocurrency.

# Development Environment

I used Deno (based off of NODE.JS), HTML, CSS, and Javascript to write this.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
* [Deno Standard Library](https://deno.land/std@0.158.0?doc)
* [Ultimate Beginner's Guide to DENO](https://medium.com/deno-the-complete-reference/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-deno-3f611d7ea964)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I made an API that contains the LIVE information of cryptocurrency prices. Just waiting to bring those in.
* I'm hoping to make it more animated and bring in several options to navigate dynamically.
* Because I spent so much time trying to figure out several other different coding languages I wasnt' able to get as far as I wanted this week but I plan to get this up and running soon.
